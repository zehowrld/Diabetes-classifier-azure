## Setup Instructions

### Step 1: Create the Workspace and Compute Resources

1. **Open Azure Portal:**
   - In your browser, navigate to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/).
   - Sign in with your Microsoft account.

2. **Open Cloud Shell:**
   - Select the [>_] (Cloud Shell) button at the top of the page, to the right of the search box.
   - Choose **Bash** if prompted. The first time you open the Cloud Shell, you will be asked to choose between Bash and PowerShell.
   - Ensure the correct subscription is specified and select **Create storage** if prompted to create storage for your Cloud Shell. Wait for the storage to be created.

3. **Clone the Repository:**
   - In the terminal, enter the following commands to clone this repository:

     ```bash
     rm -r azure-ml-labs -f
     git clone https://github.com/zehowrld/Diabetes-classifier-azure.git azure-ml-labs
     ```

4. **Navigate to the Setup Script:**
   - After the repository has been cloned, enter the following commands to change to the folder for this lab and run the `setup.sh` script:

     ```bash
     cd azure-ml-labs/Labs/(Please Enter the Lab Number Here)
     ./setup.sh
     ```

   - Ignore any error messages that say that the extensions were not installed.
   - Wait for the script to complete (this typically takes around 5-10 minutes).

### Step 2: Clone the Lab Materials

1. **Open Azure Machine Learning Studio:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to the Azure Machine Learning workspace named `mlw-dp100-...`.
   - Select the Azure Machine Learning workspace, and on its Overview page, select **Launch studio**. A new tab will open in your browser with the Azure Machine Learning studio.
   - Close any pop-ups that appear in the studio.

2. **Verify Compute Resources:**
   - Within the Azure Machine Learning studio, navigate to the **Compute** page and verify that the compute instance and cluster you created exist. The compute instance should be running, and the cluster should be idle with 0 nodes running.

3. **Install Python SDK:**
   - In the **Compute instances** tab, find your compute instance, and select the **Terminal** application.
   - In the terminal, install the Python SDK on the compute instance by running the following commands:

     ```bash
     pip uninstall azure-ai-ml
     pip install azure-ai-ml
     ```

   - Ignore any error messages that say the packages couldnâ€™t be found and uninstalled.

4. **Clone the Git Repository:**
   - Run the following command to clone a Git repository containing a notebook, data, and other files to your workspace:

     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/zehowrld/Diabetes-classifier-azure.git azure-ml-labs
     ```
